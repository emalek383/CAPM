# CAPM
In this project, I study portfolios using CAPM and calculate the Efficient Frontier.

In the first part, I compute the market betas for the stocks in a chosen portfolio and look at how good their returns are relative to their market beta and the Securit Market Line (SML). Those stocks above the SML perform better than expected from CAPM, i.e. more return for a given level systematic risk,, while those below the SML perform worse. I also test how well the returns follow the CAPM model.

In the second part, I calculate the optimal portfolios minimising risk (here, strictly meaning volatility) for a given return based on the selected stocks. These stocks lie along the Efficient Frontier. The maximum Sharpe Ratio and minimum volatility portfolios are also explicitly computed. A simulation shows that portfolios with random weights achieve less returns for the same level of risk, i.e. they lie underneath the efficient frontier.
